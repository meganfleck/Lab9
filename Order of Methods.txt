You need to have a file, describing what data
structures are used and justify the order of your algorithm. A part of your
grade is dedicated to developing an efficient algorithm.

chooseMovie method
Approach:
The method accesses an array of strings that contains the student's names and once it uses the
names as keys to find the array of RankedMov which is a class contianing objects of RankedMov
that have two fields name of the movie and the rank. Then it increases the rank by 1 while 
iterating through the movies of the students. At the end it returns the movie with the highest
rank resets the rank of the movies to 0.

Order:
My method iterates over the students and increase the rank of the movies for each student by 1.
Then it goes through again and finds the movie with the hghest rank while also reseting the rank
back to 0. The order is about O(2*N) which simplified is just O(N).
